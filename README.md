A demo project to showcase Apache Camel. Used in a talk presented to the Wellington Java Users Group, March 2015.


## Useful Info

All example should run in [Apache Service Mix 5.4](https://servicemix.apache.org/), however you will need to manually install the dependencies into Service Mix.

To install the dependencies into Service mix, run the following commands from the Service Mix console:

* features:install camel-gson
* features:install camel-mail
* features:install camel-xstream
* features:install activemq
* features:install activemq-broker
* features:install activemq-camel

[Fake SMPT](https://nilhcem.github.io/FakeSMTP/) is also useful for the email based routes.
